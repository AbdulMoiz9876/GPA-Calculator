# GPA-Calculator
This is a C# Windows Forms application that calculates the grade point average (GPA) of a student. 
The application has text boxes for inputting the student's grades, checkboxes for indicating which grades to exclude from the calculation,
combo boxes for inputting the number of credit hours for each course, and a button for performing the calculation. 
When the button is clicked, the application uses the grades and credit hours to calculate the GPA, which is then displayed in a label. 
The application also assigns a letter grade to the calculated GPA based on a predefined scale.
